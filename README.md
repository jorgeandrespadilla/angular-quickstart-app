# Angular Quickstart App

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## Features

- Angular 19 (with Node.js 20)
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the build system (see more about the new build system [here](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/build-system-migration))
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+ and npm
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/guide/setup-local) 19+

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Running the Application

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building the Application

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
